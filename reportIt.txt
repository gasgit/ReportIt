ReportIt

Application to allow users to Report problems, concerns to County Councils and ISPCA.
Council or ISPCA is selected from main page and details are selected from combobox. ( reused the reporting page layout for both, cahanged out labels etc from App.cs )

Validations are in place to remind user if orgainsation not selected, message not filled out, image no selected.
Message dialog to let user know that location is not switched on and open settings at location on/off

Users can add images already taken by device through filepicker which also has access to windows phone camera(better featured, flash, autofocusing etc)
Reports are saved to a sqlite3db on the device once emailed or shared and saved in Reports, where they can view, resend, check on map or delete(App bottom bar)

Application uses gps for reports giving coordinates.
Maps are used for 2 reasons, 1) The user needs current location to include address, road name in the reports or define which council or ISPCA to contact.
							 2) The user can look at saved reports and view a reported location on the map.
							 
Reports can be shared by email which is auto filled and ready to send, or through other applications using the share contract.
Once an organisation is selected the user can phone as the number is auto filled to telephony.
